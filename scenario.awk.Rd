\description{
given a current score and 26 points to be added to the score,
how are those points best distributed to optimize the chance
of winning?

this program computes the more general solution
provides the p vals for all scenarios for all players
generates a histogram of p vals for each player
}
\usage{
gawk -f  matchProbs.awk xls score00 score1 score2 score3 moonflag
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{xls}{
character string containing the path name for an xls output file generated by winner.awk
}
  \item{scoren}{
score for player n  	
}
  \item{moonflag}{
integer if 1 analyze scenario in which one player moons  \cr
if 0 analyze scenario in which there is no moon  	
}
}
\details{
note that the 4 score parameters must be a valid set that is present in the data file \cr
eg, must be a score that could actually occur in hearts game \cr
ie, sum of 4 scores must be multiple of 26 \cr
and scores must be given in non-descending order \cr
each individual score must be less than 100
}
\value{
returns no values, but has side effect of generating a histogram of p vals for each player
