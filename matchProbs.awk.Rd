}
\description{
compare a single score for 4 players across multiple files that had been generated by winner.awk \cr
this allows spot check reproducibility of repeated runs \cr
or comparison the effect of number of iterations \cr
or changing parameters such as "novice" versus "expert" level \cr
or calibration of proper squash function parameters \cr
}
\usage{
gawk -f  matchProbs.awk xls1 xls2 . . . score00 score1 score2 score3
gawk -f  matchProbs.awk `ls ../results/*xls` score00 score1 score2 score3 
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{xlsn}{
character string containing the path name for an xls output file generated by winner.awk \cr
or alternatively `ls ../results/*xls` to process all xls in ../results
}
  \item{scoren}{
score for player n  	
}
}
\details{
note that the 4 score parameters must be a valid set that is present in the data file \cr
eg, must be a score that could actually occur in hearts game \cr
ie, sum of 4 scores must be multiple of 26 \cr
and scores must be given in non-descending order \cr
each individual score must be less than 100 \cr
}
\value{
returns no values, but has side effect of generating a table like Table 6 in the manucript. \cr
one row for each inut file, 4 columns of probabilities for the 4 players
